This is a solution to the [Intro component with sign up form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*
  - First name and last name include special characters or numbers (extra feature)

## My process

I started with building the structure of the site mobile-first, then I added the styles. After that 
I write the script that checkes the inputs and added @media queries on top of that for desktop view of the site.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pure CSS & JS
